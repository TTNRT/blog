O﻿n this day, September 11, 2023, is the day we had an attack in this country.

2﻿ planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, and another one at the Pentagon. These attacks cost the lives of 2,999 people, firefighters and police officers.

We at TTNRT, want to remember those families that lost a loved one during this time of the attack. As the event was an important part of American history, it is a sign of memory in our hearts.

A﻿s Presiden Bush once said:

> This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace.
> America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time.
> None of us will ever forget this day.
> Yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.
