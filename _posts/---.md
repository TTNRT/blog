O﻿n this day, September 11 2023, is the day we had an attack in this conutry.

2﻿ planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, and anther one on the Pentagon. These attacks costed the lives of 2,999 people, fire fighters and police officers.

W﻿e at TTNRT, want to remember those familys that lost a loved one during this time of the attack. As the event was an importent part in American history, it is a sign of memorys into our hearts.

A﻿s Presiden Bush once said:

> This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day. Yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.
