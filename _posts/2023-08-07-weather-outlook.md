These outlooks are made to help our employees and community with safety and priority from severe or non severe weather in the Detroit Metro area.

Weather conditions are very important to keep note of, throughout your daily life, so that you can be prepared in case of severe weather strikes.

Let's take a look at our current Day 1 outlook

> SRC: Storm Prediction Center

Looking at the risks, the Detroit area is under for some thunderstorms for today. As they may become severe, they are standard type storms, with no threat at all!

However, general thunderstorms have threats of producing heavy rain fall, thunder and lightning, strong winds, and small hail (pea size).

Looking around the east cost, there appears to be a Moderate risk for most of that area too!

That risk, in general, does have capabilities to produce a tornado and large hail!

This area is for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region, and the sides of New England.
