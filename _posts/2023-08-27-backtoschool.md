Guess what time it is? It time for going back to school!

The 2023 - 2024 school starts now in the Detroit Metro Area!

We are glad to see the fall come, with the weather being stable for this time of year.

Sunshine is mosty expected for the area, with the wind coming from south of us.

Also, remember to wear a coat! The warm tempertures will change very soon this September to cold like.

Have fun this year kids!
