Today is a periodic test of the Emergency Alert System. FEMA and the FCC will test the EAS system later today at 2:20 PM for the United States. This will be shown on live TV, radio, and mobile phones. However, it is supposed to last at least a minute.

If you see the message, you will be told it's just a test. Please see the link for more details.
