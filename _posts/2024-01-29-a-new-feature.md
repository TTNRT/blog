We have a new service released for TTGit. The service is called "TTPages"! It's a client that interacts with the TTGit API, along with the abillity to host static sites straght from our servers. You can host any site you want, along with using static site generators!
This feature is new and is in beta, so you should expect some changes in the future that may come.
