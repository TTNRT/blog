This mouth has been a editing mouth for most of our services and websites. Almost all of our services use the Halfmoon framework as a replacement to the Bootstrap framework. However, we have more than just that.

## TTNRT ID
If you notice today, our theme has slightly changed. The change is effective to the login page right now. Our dev teams made a theme designed to work with our current modern theme we work with, which is Halfmoon!. This however is not fully completed yet, but more changes will occur later on this year.

## Look and feel
As we said earlier, we have made the migration to use the Halfmoon framework. This only effects our websites rather than our services. In fact, we have made at least 15 commits to our websites! That said, we been trying to make our sites more user-friendly and better uses.

## Extra sites
Most of our external sites, such as the Blog and status websites, have been migrated from Cloudflare pages to use Netlify. This change helps visitors get a faster connection.

## MyTT and identity
We haven't forgotten about MyTT, as we haven't made changes to it since April or March of this year. Most of our users are more into using the TTNRT identity system. MyTT uses PHP and with some problems that are not easy to fix. Our dev team is still working on remastering MyTT to work with NodeJS. We still ask users to use the identity system as it is more better to use.

That's all we have for today! Thank you for choosing TTNRT!
